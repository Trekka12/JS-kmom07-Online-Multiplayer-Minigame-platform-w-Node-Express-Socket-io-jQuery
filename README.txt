To fix in this project now that most of all logic is understood and figured out:
- Setup LESS for CSS rendering
- Setup Require.js for including of JS files
- Setup index.html with all the proper elements and blocks
- Implement Modernizr and YepNope feature detection and polyfill implementation
- Start Gitting the final-stage prj folder and all of its subfolders and files within
- Start NPMing the folder for Socket.io and Express.js with Node
- Format ALL files to NO-BOM
- Setup referenceArchive JS file to be used for general-purpose useful functions that will be used
- Setup projectFunctions.js with project-specific functions to be used (keep server & client "clean")
- Implement CSS-reset by Eric Meyer
- Possibly provide "local" copy of jQuery code to run for stability?
- Implement AwesomeFont for Lock icon?
